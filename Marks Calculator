# Marks Calculator (Python Program)

📌 Overview
This is a simple Python program that takes marks of 5 subjects (Hindi, English, Maths, Science, Social Science) and calculates:
- Aggregate marks (out of 500)  
- Average marks  

It was made during my practice of Python basics.  

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The program asks the user to enter marks of each subject.  
2. It adds all the marks to get the **aggregate**.  
3. It divides the total by 5 to get the **average**.  
4. Finally, it prints the result.  

## 💻 Example
Enter obtained marks from each subject:

Hindi: 80
English: 75
Maths: 90
Science: 85
Social Science: 70

Aggregate Marks: 400 /500
Average Marks: 80.0


## 📂 Files

#🚀 Future Plans

As I learn more, I will improve this project by:
- Adding more subjects dynamically  
- Showing percentage and grade  
- Making a user-friendly menu
- Writing cleaner code in fewer lines
